While for the US government, it provides a release for troops  & help maintain troop morale; keep unruly soldiers away from ‘normal’ civilians. Throughout history, Korean comfort women have been brought to light and the“history of Korean prostitution linked to Korea’s political & military subjugation by foreign countries”  (17) The first foreign power to enact prostitution had been Japan during its imperialism and then US during the Korean War.

These tales can be see as deep-rooted American racism against Asians. Korean women were not the only country affected. Asian countries with US military bases and camptowns have districts created with the purpose of offering services to US soldiers. Camptowns have now evolved into districts economically dependent of the US military’s presence.
