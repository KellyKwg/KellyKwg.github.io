	Scene 1<br>
	<br>
	Is this your prayer? It may be answere. Come, <br>
	Listen to me, act as the crisis demands, <br>
	And you shall have relief from all these evils. <br>
	<br>
	Until now I was a stranger to this tale, <br> 
	As I had been a stranger to the crime. <br>
	Could I track down the murderer without a clue? <br>
	But now, friends, <br>
	As one who became a citizen atfter the murder, <br> 
	I make this proclamation to all Thebans: <br>
	If any man knows whose hand Laius, son of Labdacus, <br>
	Met his death, I direct that man to tell me everything. <br>
	No matter what he fears for having so long withheld it. <br>
	Let it stand as promised that no further trouble <br>
	Will come to him, but he may leave the land in safety. <br> 
	<br>
	Having the power that he held before me, <br>
	Having his bed, begetting children there <br>
	Upon his wife, as he would have, had he lived — <br>
	Their son would have been my children's brother, <br>
	If Laius had had lick in fatherhood! <br>
	(But surely ill luck rushed upon his reign) — <br>
	I say I take the son's part, just as though <br>
	I were his son, to press the fight for him <br>
	And see it won! I'll find the hand that brought <br>
	Death to Labdacus' and Polydorus' child. <br>
	Heir of Cadmus' and Agenor's line. <br>
	And as for those who fail me, <br>
	May the gods deny them the fruit of the earth, <br>
	Fruit of the womb, may they rot utterly! <br>
	Let them be wretched as we are wretched, <br>
	and worse! <br>
	<br>
