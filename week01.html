	<h1>Week 1 Assignment</h1>
	<h2>As We May Think</h2>

		My biggest realization whilst I read the article was the importance of advancement. The continued creation of new ideas and experimenting. As this article was derived from 1945 I was especially surprised to read about ideas that have already come to fruition. The technology and ideas that Bush conveys have already been created and made. For example, Bush mentions "dry photography", in today's we can get an instantaneous photo with a click on our phones or a digital camera. Besides photography, we can also copy and print images in an instant. The time spent capturing an image and maturing the photo takes a fraction of the time spent developing in dye and drying.

		I think Tim Berners Lee's fundamental concept of the Web is interesting. The idea is that anyone can share information with anyone, anywhere. Yet with the constant evolution of the internet,it is beginning to stray away from the original principal. Nowadays there are social networking sites collecting information from their users, the government monitoring, Internet providers slowing down traffic for their gain. Lee continues to stress the fact that the Web is yours. It is yours to create and it's yours to protect. With the constant threat from scams to protecting your speech. It is an essential part of our democracy.Also, the notion of universality, I did not use to think much about. After reading this piece I agree with Lee in that the Web and information should be accessible from anywhere to everywhere. The idea of Net Neutrality also stems from this concept as well. The principle is that providers need to give users access to all sites, content, applications at the same speed with no preference. Again, Lee notes that the purpose of the Web is to serve humanity.
