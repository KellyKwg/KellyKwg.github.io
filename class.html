      <p>Bergers discusses the importance of perspective and how the camera has led to the meaning behind paintings to change. With the ability to reproduce paintings and  to view painting virtually anywhere rather than one specific location. Bergers states "Images come to you, you do not go to them." With the invention of the camera there is not longer the necessity to visit a museum to see the original work of art. You can now view it in different outlets, posters, photos, on the internet. Bergers also comments on how when isolating different parts of a painting rather than looking at it as a collective whole the meaning of a painting can change. The focus or the perspective shifts. Cameras and photos have also become a form of information. They must capture someone's attention in the midst of text. The meanings behind painting have come ambiguous and open to interpretation.</p>

      <p>In episode 2, Berger dives in the how nudes are portrayed in European oil paintings. Nudes of women are displayed as if they are submissive to men. He makes a point in that nakedness is created in the eyes of the beholder. The beholder mostly being men. He later states that a women's image of herself, the image or mirror she looks at is derived from other people. How other people see her. The criteria oil painting create of women is not accurate or created to be accurate. Berger explains that a body is put o display as a disguise. The women are not showing their real self just what the beholder wants to see. The idea that women are submissive by nature and at the mercy of judgement from men is still seen today. Social media and the internet are examples of this. Women post an image of themselves online and the audience believes that is what she looks like or behaves. But the story and expression she may present could just be a fraction of her real self that most will not really understand unless verbally stated.</p>

      <p>Berger then describes the reason behind the value of oil paintings. Rather than just the tangible value of a painting he discusses the reason as to why people buy the paintings and what they represent. Oil paintings as he stated depict a symbol for wealth an power. The objects and the confidence of individuals in the paintings are what drives people to purchase them and display it in their homes. As a means to present the allusion of status. The idea that paintings glorify the ability to even purchase and to own is interesting. A painting can hold such power even without actually purchasing said object portrayed. They depict an owner's wealth and about what they could own or what they already own.</p>
